# CMPUT 503 - Experimental Mobile Robotics

Course GitHub repository for CMPUT 503 Experimental Mobile Robotics, taught at the University of 
Alberta in Winter 2025. 

My course website, that includes the written reports for each exercise, is found [here](https://google.com).

## Course description (from the syllabus)
Robots are awesome, when they actually work. The goal of this class is to give students hands-on experience using robots with ROS, the Robot Operating System. This class will be experimental: students will demonstrate mastery of the material primarily by submitting and demonstrating working robots using the Duckietown platform.

There are a few in-class assessments, but the majority of the grade will be earned collaboratively by demonstrating mastery of the fundamentals of robotic autonomy through hands-on experience. You will be expected to demonstrate your understanding of the material through in-lab demonstrations, projects, and by maintaining a website and git repository to showcase your work.
